00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.690
Ken: Kelly Roofing was started in 1972 by my father, Joe Kelly.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.585
We service the southwest Florida area.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:12.945
This is where we grew up, and this is where we're most comfortable.

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:17.556
Staying local allows us to build nice strong relationships with each one of our customers.

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:21.089
Joe: Our main mission our dad always instilled into us, he said

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.353
"If you always just make sure that your customer is happy and provide good customer service...

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:27.042
...you'll never have to worry about going to finding work, it'll just come to you."

00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:30.732
Ken: We're deeply passionate about the customer opinion of how we do.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.231
We love creating raving fans and cheerleaders  

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.377
that go and spread the word about Kelly Roofing, and the experience they had with us.  

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.989
By using technology, we can ensure that the customer receives the experience 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.937
that  they expected to receive.

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:48.277
Joe: It's funny because we're just a little local family owned and operated business.

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:53.037
However, I can't tell you how many times customers have the perception that   we're a national company.

00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:55.536
And the computer system helps that perception. 

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:01.406
Ken:  We started with Office 365 and realized what the Cloud could do for us.  

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:05.052
Online was really important to us. The reason why is because we are so mobile.

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.634
We didn't want to have to worry about uptime, and all those other issues

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.782
that Office 365 got us away from. 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.879
We wanted to take our business to the next step, so we started looking for a piece of software  

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:18.432
that would allow us to manage our business and our customer relations much better

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:21.158
and that's when we found Microsoft Dynamics CRM online. 

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:25.388
We really liked how CRM online integrated with Office 365. 

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:30.302
We wanted our team to be faster at what they were doing so they had more time to spend with the customer. 

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:34.145
Jennifer: When a customer calls in for an estimate, we can take note of that 

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:36.018
right in the computer, right in that moment.

00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:39.001
We document it and then I can schedule an appointment for them. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.719
Joe: CRM is able to synchronize that right to the schedule.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:45.032
Literally, my guys wake up in the morning, they open up their schedule, 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.411
and they know where to go because it's already been set up for them.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.782
What's so nice about CRM is whenever you talk to the customer, you can add those notes in.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.948
It gives you an automatic reminder to follow up with that customer

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.620
and you're also able to review your notes so you can pick up right where you left off.

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:02.550
Jennifer: I love CRM because it allows us to automate the mundane tasks

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.382
so that I can spend more time with my customers. 

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.165
Joe: Before we used  to have five people to handle all of the clerical work.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.017
Now, with the automation, one person can handle all of that. 

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:16.232
Ken: CRM online has allowed us to focus on our customers, make our people happy, 

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.427
and improve our business. 

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.388
Knowing that we have doubled our revenue, kept the staff the same size, 

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.924
and increased customer satisfaction

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.907
proves that we made the right decision.
